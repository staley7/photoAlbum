# photoAlbum
Easiest way to build this project is to clone the project from github into a eclipse instance.
Once the project has been clone and imported into Eclipse right click on App file, then click run -> java application.
Eclipse's console will be used to send and recieve input/output.
Entering in an alubm id will cause the album info to be displayed, and entering exit will cause the program to end.
